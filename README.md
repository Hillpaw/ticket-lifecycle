Once everything is completed, you are able to change the ticket's status at the bottom of the page. You have three options: Open, Resolved, and Closed.
Open is to show that the ticket is active and being worked on. 
Resolved is when the end-user's problem has been dealt with. 
Closed is of a similar fashion as Resolved, and the end-user no longer needs assistance.
